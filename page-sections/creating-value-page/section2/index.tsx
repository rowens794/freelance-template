                I'm constantly running into advisors who follow a formula for
                subpar results from the web. They find a development company
                that will build a site using a templated format and standardized
                copy, take the site live, and expect results to roll in.

              <p className="mx-auto my-4 prose">
                This undifferentiated approach rarely works. The content doesn't
                incentivize search engines to rank your pages highly, and when
                potential customers find your website, it does nothing to
                convince them you're any different than the 20 other firms in
                your market following the same approach.{' '}

                To have success, you need to do four things right:

                And this should be done in a way that is different from your
                competitors and compelling to your visitors.

                While getting it right is hard, it can be lucrative. Bringing on
                a single new advisory client can often generate enough revenue
                to cover a decade's worth of web development expenses.

                Building a Strong Web Presence is Hard
              </h3>
              <p className="mx-auto my-4 prose">
                I understand why it is so difficult for advisors to commit to
                their web presence. The steps necessary to implement are both
                challenging to execute and foreign to the language of a typical
                investment advisor (I should know I used to be one).

                Much like your clients don't need to understand every manager or
                security selection decision made in their portfolio, you only
                need to have a broad understanding of the topics that will drive
                results from your website so that you can make informed
                decisions when you outsource the project.
