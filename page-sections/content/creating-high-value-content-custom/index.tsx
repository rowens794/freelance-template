                As an advisor, there is a constant tension between servicing
                existing clients and growing your practice. Finding and meeting
                with prospects is time-consuming and resource-draining.

              <p>Enter scalable marketing channels.</p>
              <p>
                Social media, online and traditional advertising, and of course,
                your web presence offer the promise of relief. These channels
                can provide you with a consistent source of new opportunities
                that are already familiar with you and your services.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem is that getting these channels right is complicated,
                time-consuming, and financially riskyâ€”you may need to commit to
                a social media strategy for months before you see any results.
                Advertisers require a minimum spend with no guarantee of how
                many new leads you will generate. And setting a polished
                website, even with just a handful of pages, can cost north of
                $10,000 at a quality agency, yet you'll get no promises about
                how well it will convert.
              </p>

              <h3>Let's Remove the Risk</h3>
              <p>
                What are the most significant risks you face going into a major
                marketing project?
              </p>
              <p>In my experience, there are two:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The time you will invest in overseeing/executing the project,
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  The financial commitment you will need to make to test the
                  channel.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Removing the Time Commitment</h4>
              <p>
                Launching or re-launching a website is a major project. As the
                business owner, you'll need to be involved in setting the
                website's tone, the pages that are created, the copy & graphics
                that populate those pages, and reviewing and requesting edits as
                necessary. It's a lot of work, requiring potentially dozens of
                hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because I come from the wealth management space, I can remove a
                lot of this work for you. I know the language that clients
                speak, how to sell these services, and how to visually represent
                the value you provide. By hiring a former investment advisor as
                your web developer, you remove a massive chunk of the labor you
                would otherwise be exposed to in ensuring that the content
                reflects your firm correctly.
              </p>
              <h4>Removing the Financial Commitment</h4>
              <p>
                Web Development work is primarily done upfront. A developer will
                commit dozens or even hundreds of hours to a project, go through
                multiple revisions with a client, invoice the client for the
                project along the way and finally deploy the project into the
                wild.
              </p>
              <p>
                This seems reasonable; the developer is doing work - they want
                to get paid. However, it leaves the advisor in a problematic
                situation. The developer could do shoddy work that doesn't bring
                any results for the advisor, yet they still get paid. An obvious
                conflict of interest exists: the advisor wants results, and the
                developer wants to finish the project as quickly as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                I attack the problem differently. I essentially finance the
                project myself and charge you, the advisor, monthly for the work
                that's been done. I don't require any upfront payment or
                long-term commitment. I can do this because I'm confident that
                my work will deliver the result you want, and you will want to
                continue a relationship with me.
