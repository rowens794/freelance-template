                As a small business owner myself, I understand the struggle of
                commiting to a multi-thousand dollar project with no guarantee
                of results. These situations make me very uncomfortable. To the
                point where I end up delaying or avoiding action that I need to
                take to move my business forward.

            <div className="mx-auto mt-5 prose text-gray-500 prose-primary lg:col-start-1 lg:row-start-1 lg:max-w-none">
              <p>
                This disjuction between the high cost/commitment of high-quality
                web developement projects and the lack of certainty around the
                results these projects will bring is the reason I started
                Conversion Pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to build something that would allow other business
                owners to quickly pull the trigger on what would typically be an
                expensive and time consuming project: Building a high-quality
                web presence.
              </p>
              <p>
                To do this, I knew I needed to take a major risk with every new
                client I brought on - I needed to self-fund the cost of building
                their website and wager that they would be so pleased with the
                product, service, and results that they would stay on as
                long-term clients of mine.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is exactly what I've built for myself and more importantly
                my customers.
              </p>
              <h3>Who Does this Model Work For</h3>
              <p>
                My best customers are small businesses that have either tried to
                DIY a website themselves, using tools like Wix and Wordpress, or
                have no experience on the web at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                I provide these folks with a low risk way to experience the
                results that a professionally designed website can bring.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you'd think nothing of writing a check for $10 grand for a
                website or if you have an in-house marketing team that can put
                together high quality content and designs - then I'm probably
                not for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the other hand. If your primary focus is on serving your
                customers day in and day out and you want a new channel to bring
                business to your doorstep, without taking a lot of risk. Then I
                might be exactly the solution you've been looking for.
